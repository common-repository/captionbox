The CaptionBox plugin, by SpeakerText, automatically loads the CaptionBox interactive transcript player beneath each of your videos, improving SEO. SpeakerText account required.

== Description ==

SpeakerText turns your videos into text so that they can be read, found and shared by everyone.  This Wordpress plugin simplifies the process of installing our CaptionBox interactive transcript product on your website.  For more information, please visit http://speakertext.com/captionbox_wp 

CaptionBox transcripts are indexed by Google for SEO. CaptionBox also makes it simple for visitors to share quotes from your videos on Twitter and Facebook. Whenever this happens, CaptionBox automatically includes a time-stamped short URL back to your site that starts the video at that exact quote.

Whenever a visitor copy & pastes a quote from your video transcript, CaptionBox turns that quote into a hyperlink back to your site and starts the video at the matching time cue. 

You must have a SpeakerText account and transcripts to use the CaptionBox plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `captionbox` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder on your site. Or install the plugin directly from your admin console.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. 
1. Place SpeakerText HTML transcripts in a folder on your website.
1. Let CaptionBox know where your transcripts are on the CaptionBox settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: Do I have to pay for SpeakerText?
A: Yes, we're a business! 

Q: Does SpeakerText use speech-to-text software to transcribe my videos?
A: SpeakerText uses a combination of artificial and human intelligence to create high-quality video transcripts at low cost.

Q: Do I have to copy & paste the transcripts onto my site? 
A: No! Just put the transcript files in a folder on your site and CaptionBox will load them automatically in a `<div>` tag beneath each one of your videos.

Q: Why is there a space between my video and the transcript? 
A: WordPress automatically adds a `<p>` tag after each embed and then adds a `</p>` tag before the SpeakerText `<div>`, causing there to be a space. You can specify a margin correction in the SpeakerText settings page.

Q: Do SpeakerText transcripts affect my site SEO? 
A: Yes, SpeakerText transcripts load server-side and thus get indexed by Google for SEO!
